# Meilin "Mei" Lee – Character Reference

  

This file focuses on Mei as a LoRA target: physical appearance, animation language, emotional range, and key scene types.

  

## 1. Basic identity

  

-  **Full name:** Meilin Lee (often called "Mei" or "Mei‑Mei")

-  **Age:** 13

-  **Ethnicity / nationality:** Chinese‑Canadian, living in Toronto

-  **Role:** Protagonist; narrator of the story

-  **Forms:** Human teenage girl; giant red panda (shapeshifting triggered by strong emotion)

  

----------

  

## 2. Human form – physical appearance

  

### 2.1 General build and proportions

  

- Short, slightly stocky early‑teen body type; not stylized as thin.

- Round face, soft features, and a very expressive mouth and eyebrows.

- Posture often leans forward with energetic movement; she walks quickly, gestures with her hands a lot, and frequently moves in little hops or half‑jumps when excited.

  

### 2.2 Face & hair

  

- Light skin with a natural flush in the cheeks; small blemishes and faint pimples emphasize real teen skin rather than perfect smoothness.

- Large, light brown eyes behind thin silver oval glasses; thick dark eyebrows that squash and stretch dramatically.

- Short bob haircut, dyed a reddish‑orange shade; bangs parted slightly off‑center.

- Hair accessories: teal barrette on one side, two magenta clips on the other, plus tiny star‑shaped yellow earrings.

  

### 2.3 Signature outfits

  

Focus on the main looks you are likely to extract for training:

  

1.  **School / everyday outfit**

- Red cardigan, slightly oversized, with a small pattern or emblem.

- Pinkish shirt or top under the cardigan.

- Purple skirt, knee‑length.

- Leggings or socks and simple sneakers.

- Backpack and flute case as frequent props.

2.  **Temple helper outfit**

- More formal red‑and‑green clothing or blazer when acting as tour guide.

- Sometimes wears a green blazer similar to Ming’s when she imitates her mother’s serious persona.

3.  **Concert / casual teen looks**

- Variants of T‑shirts, hoodies, and fan merch items (4★Town logos, hand‑drawn decorations).

- Glow sticks or handmade signs at the SkyDome concert.

  

----------

  

## 3. Red panda form – design notes

  

### 3.1 Overall design

  

- Approximately eight feet tall in‑universe, but animated with very soft, plush proportions.

- Fur is a rich red‑orange with cream‑colored accents on the muzzle, eyebrows, inner ears, and belly.

- Massive fluffy tail with alternating red and cream rings; tail is almost as long as her body and used heavily in posing and silhouette.

- Paws are large and rounded, with soft‑looking paw pads; claws are rarely emphasized except in brief action beats.

- Ears flick and flatten with emotion; eyebrows and cheeks puff when she’s flustered.

  

### 3.2 Emotional indicators

  

-  **Embarrassed / shy:** Ears droop, cheeks flush deeper, tail wraps around body for comfort.

-  **Excited / hyper:** Eyes wide, mouth open in a huge grin, tail whipping back and forth; jumps and bounces.

-  **Angry / overwhelmed:** Eyes glow bright red, fur bristles, teeth show, stance becomes more aggressive, sometimes framed like a kaiju shot even at Mei’s smaller size.

-  **Calm / grounded:** Panda relaxes into rounder poses, shoulders down, tail gently curved rather than frizzed.

  

### 3.3 Key scenes for panda LoRA

  

- First transformation in the bathroom and bedroom: messy fur, panic, confined interior spaces.

- School scenes where she accidentally transforms in front of classmates.

- Tyler’s birthday party: upbeat, party lighting, kids riding on panda’s back.

- Fund‑raising montage at school: panda posing for photos, hugging students, doing silly poses.

- Concert confrontation: dynamic combat‑style staging between panda‑Mei and giant panda‑Ming, dramatic lighting, smoke, confetti.

- Astral plane panda presence alongside human Mei.

  

----------

  

## 4. Personality & behavior

  

### 4.1 Baseline traits

  

- Extremely energetic and talkative; gives herself little pep talks and narrates her own life in a slightly cringey but sincere way.

- Over‑achiever mentality: keeps color‑coded schedules, proudly shows off high grades, and takes responsibility at the temple.

- Deeply loyal to her friends; easily slips into leader mode when planning schemes (like the fund‑raising plan for concert tickets).

- Very sensitive to her mother’s approval; prone to guilt and self‑blame when she thinks she’s disappointed Ming.

  

### 4.2 Character arc

  

- Starts the film fully aligned with her mother’s expectations, almost bragging about being an ideal daughter.

- The red panda triggers a crisis: she can no longer hide parts of herself that are messy, crush‑obsessed, or rebellious.

- Through her friends and the experience of being the panda, she learns that her desires and emotions are valid and not something to be sealed away.

- By the end she integrates both sides—dutiful daughter and chaotic teen—choosing to keep the panda while still loving her family.

  

### 4.3 Typical gestures and acting beats

  

Useful for annotating or clustering frames:

  

- Striking dramatic poses when making a point (hands on hips, finger jabbing the air).

- Overly enthusiastic wave‑smiles, sometimes with a slight nervous edge.

- Full‑body cringe collapse when mortified (sliding down lockers, hiding behind objects).

- Quick doodling and scribbling when obsessed with something (e.g., drawings of Devon or concert fantasies).

- Hug‑piles with friends, often jumping into group embraces.

  

----------

  

## 5. Relationships and dynamics

  

### 5.1 Ming Lee (mother)

  

- Central emotional axis of the movie.

- Ming is intensely proud of Mei but also controlling and fearful of Mei making mistakes.

- Their conflict often plays out through body language: Ming looming over Mei, Mei shrinking or forcing a smile; later in the film, Mei literally stands up to her mother in panda form.

- The resolution involves mutual vulnerability: Mei sees Ming as a struggling former teen rather than an infallible authority, and Ming learns to step back.

  

### 5.2 Jin Lee (father)

  

- Quiet, gentle, and observant.

- Often seen in the background cooking or quietly supporting Mei.

- His main emotional contribution is a calm conversation where he shows Mei camcorder footage of her enjoying the panda form with her friends, encouraging her not to be ashamed of that side of herself.

  

### 5.3 Friends – Miriam, Priya, Abby

  

- The three friends feel like distinct archetypes:

-  **Miriam:** chill, skater‑ish, supportive, acts as emotional glue of the group.

-  **Priya:** deadpan, goth‑leaning, quietly enthusiastic.

-  **Abby:** small but explosive ball of energy and aggression, with a big soft spot for cute things.

- Together they validate Mei’s panda and help her regulate it; visual framing often puts the four of them in tight clusters or matching poses.

  

### 5.4 Tyler Nguyen‑Baker

  

- Starts as a loud, bratty classmate who teases Mei and weaponizes her embarrassment.

- Over the film, he reveals himself to be another secret 4★Town fan and eventually becomes part of the friend group.

- Visually, his arc is tracked from antagonistic smirks and mockery to shared excitement at the concert and later casual inclusion in friend group shots.

  

### 5.5 4★Town

  

- The boy band never interacts with Mei directly beyond performance staging, but their music and imagery live in her head and room decor.

- For LoRA work, 4★Town provides stylized stage lighting, boy‑band choreography, and fan‑crowd compositions rather than character‑study material.

  

----------

  

## 6. Captioning tips for Mei‑focused datasets

  

- Use separate tags for:

-  `mei_lee` (human form)

-  `mei_lee_red_panda` (panda form)

-  `turning_red_style` (overall film style)

- Include emotional tags such as `embarrassed`, `angry`, `excited`, `crying`, `joyful`, and `determined` since the film leans heavily on exaggerated emotion.

- Add relationship tags when relevant, e.g., `with_ming_lee`, `with_miriam`, `with_priya`, `with_abby`, `with_tyler`.

- Note key props: glasses, flute case, Tamagotchi, 4★Town posters, temple broom, panda tail.

# Turning Red – Supporting Characters Reference

----------

  

## 7. Tyler Nguyen‑Baker

  

-  **Role:** Classmate who shifts from antagonist to reluctant friend.

-  **Appearance:** Slightly taller boy with messy hair, braces, loud sports jerseys, and a smug or teasing expression.

----------

  

## 9. Devon, Stacy, and other classmates

  

These characters mostly support specific plot beats and provide variety in crowd shots.

  

-  **Devon:** Teen clerk at the Daisy Mart; object of Mei’s original crush. Visual focus: convenience‑store setting, flirty doodles, awkward real‑life encounters.

-  **Stacy:** Classmate who first spots panda‑Mei in the bathroom; used to show how quickly rumors spread at school.

-  **Other classmates:** Provide reaction shots—screaming, cheering, taking photos, or gossiping.

  

----------

  

## 10. 4★Town (Robaire, Jesse, Aaron Z., Aaron T., Tae Young)

  

-  **Role:** Fictional boy band adored by Mei and her friends.

-  **Visual design:** Each member has a distinct color and silhouette—tall leader with earrings, softer "sweet" member, energetic dancer, etc.—designed to echo real early‑2000s boy bands.

-  **Use for datasets:** Excellent for concert lighting, group choreography, and crowd‑interaction shots, but usually secondary if the primary goal is Mei‑focused LoRA training.

  

----------

  

## 11. Captioning tips for supporting characters

  

- Use consistent tags for each character, e.g., `ming_lee`, `jin_lee`, `miriam_mendelsohn`, `priya_mangal`, `abby_park`, `tyler_nguyen_baker`, `grandma_wu`, `4town`.

- When scenes include multiple characters, order tags by prominence in the frame (foreground to background) to help any future weighting schemes.

- Include role or relationship tags where helpful: `meis_mother`, `meis_father`, `meis_friends`, `school_bully`, `boy_band`.

- Add setting tags (`school_hallway`, `temple_courtyard`, `convenience_store`, `stadium_concert`, `astral_plane`) so you can later slice data for background or style LoRAs.
