## Quick Reference

Bryce Markwell is the kid who _could_ have been Elio’s first real friend on Earth if social pressure hadn’t gotten in the way. He’s a slender Black middle‑schooler with a red‑and‑white shirt, blue pants and a slightly nervous smile. He shares Elio’s fascination with aliens and ham radio, but spends much of the film stuck in the gravitational pull of his more aggressive friend **Caleb**. Bryce’s arc moves from bystander and participant in bullying to someone who owns his mistakes and actively helps Elio.

----------

## 1. Background

-   Student at Elio’s school; attends **Camp Carver** at the same time.
    
-   Probably comes from a relatively ordinary, non‑military family; nothing suggests he lives on base.
    
-   Finds ham radios cool rather than weird and is intrigued enough by Elio’s flyers to bring his own set to the beach one night.
    
-   Socially, he seems to float in Caleb’s orbit, benefiting from that proximity while also enduring Caleb’s moods.
    

The film implies he is fundamentally kind but conflict‑avoidant, making him easy to recruit into bullying.

----------

## 2. Personality

-   **Friendly and curious:** Initially approaches Elio with genuine interest, asking questions instead of mocking him.
    
-   **Non‑confrontational:** Struggles to say “no” to Caleb; often laughs along awkwardly rather than resist.
    
-   **Guilty conscience:** After things go too far and Elio is hurt, Bryce clearly feels bad and later apologizes.
    
-   **Technically inclined:** Comfortable with radio gear; not as obsessive as Elio, but competent enough to help with later communications.
    
-   **Eager to make amends:** In the third act, he proactively joins the effort to relay signals to the Communiverse.

## 3. Physical Appearance & Visual Design

-   **Body type:** Slim, slightly taller than Elio.
    
-   **Skin tone:** Darker brown; clearly coded as African‑American.
    
-   **Hair:** Short, textured hair; may be styled in a simple fade or curls depending on scene.
    
-   **Eyes:** Dark brown.
    

### Default outfit

-   **Top:** Red shirt with white accents or patterning.
    
-   **Bottoms:** Long light‑blue pants with darker stripes.
    
-   **Shoes:** Black sneakers.
    

### Camp outfit

-   Blue scout‑style uniform similar to Elio’s, but with **more merit badges** on the sash, subtly implying he is better integrated into normal social structures.
    

Posture tends to be slightly hunched or turned toward Caleb when the latter is present, reflecting his divided loyalties.

## 4. Relationships

### Elio Solis

-   Starts as a potential friend: they bond over alien talk and radios.
    
-   Bryce’s failure to defend Elio during bullying becomes a key emotional wound.
    
-   Later, his apology and concrete help are framed as meaningful growth; the film treats his attempt to do better as important, especially for young viewers learning about complicity.
    

### Caleb

-   Bryce’s main friend before Elio; their dynamic is unbalanced.
    
-   He admires Caleb’s confidence but is also clearly uncomfortable with the cruelty.
    
-   Eventually chooses to break from Caleb’s influence, siding with Elio and Olga’s team instead.
    

### Other kids / background

-   Often shown among groups of campers; does not stand out as an outcast the way Elio does.

## 5. Story Role & Key Moments

1.  **Beach radio scene:** Shows up responding to Elio’s ham‑radio flyer; they tune frequencies together, hinting at a genuine connection.
    
2.  **Camp bullying:** Under Caleb’s lead, wears masks and participates in chasing Elio; his hesitation is visible even as he goes along.
    
3.  **Aftermath of abduction:** Reacts in shock when Elio is beamed up; later, guilt hangs over him.
    
4.  **Third‑act redemption:** Uses his radio equipment and knowledge to help forward messages from Olga’s team to the Communiverse. This is his tangible way of making things right.
    
5.  **Closing montage:** Present as part of Elio’s widening circle of friends, suggesting an ongoing, healthier friendship.

-   **Dataset use:** secondary human reference for tween boy body type; “friend potential” facial expressions distinct from outright antagonists like Caleb.
