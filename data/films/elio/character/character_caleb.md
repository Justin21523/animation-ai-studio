# Caleb — Character Profile

**Film:** Elio (2025, Pixar)  
**Role:** Secondary antagonist / school bully  
**Voice Actor:** Jake Getman  
**Age:** Early teens (around 13)  
**Species:** Human  
**Home:** Montez, Earth

----------

## Quick Reference

Caleb is the sharp‑tongued, physically imposing middle‑schooler who turns Elio’s alien obsession into a target. He is not a cackling super‑villain but a very recognizable kind of kid: insecure, attention‑seeking, and afraid of looking weak, so he performs cruelty to stay on top. His design reads as a lanky, athletic boy in a camp uniform, often smirking or scowling. Over the course of the film he pushes Bryce into bullying Elio, indirectly causing the incident that leaves Elio wearing an eyepatch.

----------

## 1. Personality

-   **Cruel and mocking:** Quickly spots Elio’s vulnerabilities (grief, weird hobbies) and uses them for jokes.
    
-   **Manipulative:** Knows how to steer Bryce and other kids, framing bullying as “just joking” or group fun.
    
-   **Status‑focused:** Enjoys being the loudest and most feared kid; uses dares and public taunts to maintain his image.
    
-   **Emotionally avoidant:** The film hints that he is hiding his own fears and insecurities—possibly about family or fitting in—but he never articulates them clearly.
    
-   **Not irredeemable, but unrepentant on screen:** We see discomfort crack his façade in a few moments, but he never gets a fully redemptive arc like Bryce.
    

From a thematic perspective, Caleb represents how toxic masculinity and peer pressure manifest at the middle‑school level.

## 2. Physical Appearance & Visual Design

-   **Body type:** Taller and more solidly built than Elio and Bryce; reads as sporty.
    
-   **Skin tone & hair:** Human boy with mid‑tone skin and short hair (exact color can vary by scene within brown‑to‑dark‑blond range).
    
-   **Facial expressions:** Smirks, eye‑rolls, raised eyebrows; occasionally flashes of genuine fear when supernatural events occur.
    

### Clothing

-   **School / casual:** Simple T‑shirts and shorts; muted colors.
    
-   **Camp Carver uniform:** Blue scout shirt with patches, shorts, neckerchief; similar silhouette to Bryce but typically posed more aggressively (hands on hips, shoulders forward).
    

Because his design is more generic than Elio’s or Bryce’s, captions should be explicit about context to prevent confusion with random background kids.

----------

## 3. Relationships

### Elio Solis

-   Primary bullying target. Caleb mocks Elio’s eyepatch, dead parents, and obsession with aliens.
    
-   Organizes the mask‑wearing scare at camp, leading to the physical tussle just before the abduction.
    
-   Elio’s journey toward self‑acceptance does not include forgiving Caleb; instead, the film quietly sidelines him by the end.
    

### Bryce Markwell

-   Treats Bryce as both sidekick and audience; expects him to laugh and back up cruel jokes.
    
-   Resents Bryce’s hesitation when Bryce starts to question the bullying.
    
-   Their dynamic illustrates how a charismatic kid can weaponize friendships.
    

### Other campers

-   Caleb is their ringleader; kids follow his cues during group scenes.

## 4. Story Role & Key Moments

1.  **Early teasing:** Makes snide comments about Elio’s flyers and alien obsession at school or camp.
    
2.  **Mask chase:** Leads a group of campers in monster masks to chase Elio through the woods and around cabins at night.
    
3.  **Physical confrontation:** Shoves Elio; in the chaos, Elio’s eye is injured, leading to the eyepatch. The UFO arrival interrupts further violence.
    
4.  **Post‑abduction shock:** Briefly appears stunned when Elio disappears into the sky, showing that even bullies can be shaken.
    
5.  **Late‑film presence:** Appears in background shots at camp or school; sees Bryce drifting away from his influence.
    

He functions as the very human, grounded source of fear that parallels cosmic threats like Lord Grigon.
