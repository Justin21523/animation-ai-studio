----------

## Quick Reference

Elio Solis is an imaginative, lonely boy who copes with the loss of his parents by fixating on aliens and the possibility of escape into space. He is small for his age, with messy dark hair, a permanent eyepatch for much of the film, and a homemade “cosmic hero” costume — colander helmet, purple cape, and glow‑in‑the‑dark alien T‑shirt. Emotionally, he is a classic Pixar “soft kid”: anxious, sarcastic, easily overwhelmed, but capable of huge empathy once given space to be himself. His arc moves from wanting to flee Earth entirely to accepting that he can build connection both at home and among the stars.

## 1. Background & Family Context

-   Orphaned after the death of both parents; the emotional aftermath shapes everything about him.
    
-   Taken in by **Olga Solis**, his aunt, an Air Force major working on a classified extraterrestrial contact program on a military base near Montez.
    
-   Grows up surrounded by institutional rules, security checkpoints, and a culture of toughness that clashes with his sensitive personality.
    
-   Spends a lot of time indoors, drawing aliens, tinkering with electronics, and listening to radio static.
    
-   Lacks close friends at school; his social world before the Communiverse mostly consists of Olga, occasional interactions with scientists on base, and the fantasy “friends” he imagines in space.

## 2. Personality

Key traits:

-   **Imaginative & idealistic:** Builds elaborate head‑canon about what aliens are like, projecting his desire for kindness and understanding onto them.
    
-   **Socially anxious:** Stumbles over words, cracks awkward jokes, and tends to catastrophize social situations, especially around peers his age.
    
-   **Sarcastic coping style:** Uses humor and eye‑rolling quips to mask fear; this carries over into his attempts at intergalactic diplomacy.
    
-   **Empathetic:** Reads other people’s emotions quickly, especially Glordon’s discomfort with his father’s expectations.
    
-   **Conflict‑avoidant yet stubborn:** Hates confrontation but will dig in if he feels someone is being unfair or cruel, as with Caleb’s bullying.
    
-   **Craving validation:** Being called “ambassador of Earth” hits a deep nerve; he wants to feel chosen and important, which fuels his initial lies.
    

Emotionally, he oscillates between small, withdrawn body language on Earth and exaggerated, performative confidence in the Communiverse, especially when posturing in front of the council.

## 3. Physical Appearance & Visual Design

### Core design

-   **Body type:** Short, slightly chubby pre‑teen; soft, rounded features (Pixar “bean” body proportions).
    
-   **Skin tone:** Warm medium tan, reflecting his Latinx heritage.
    
-   **Hair:** Thick, dark brown/black hair, cut short but left fluffy and slightly unruly.
    
-   **Eyes:** Large brown eye; the other is covered for much of the story by an eyepatch.
    
-   **Eyepatch:** Dark patch over one eye following a bullying incident; later removed in some scenes, so datasets should distinguish “with eyepatch” vs “without”.
    

### Everyday clothing

-   Bright **green T‑shirt** with a cute alien face or UFO motif on the chest.
    
-   Knee‑length **greenish shorts**.
    
-   White crew socks, often slightly bunched.
    
-   Dark sneakers.
    

### “Cosmic hero” costume

This is the most iconic look for LoRA training.

-   Upturned **metal colander helmet** decorated with stickers, wires and makeshift antennae.
    
-   Flowing **purple cape** with green lining or patches, sometimes billowing behind him.
    
-   Same alien T‑shirt and shorts as baseline outfit, sometimes partially obscured.
    

### Camp & formal variants

-   **Camp Carver uniform:** Blue or teal scout shirt with patches, matching sash, shorts, and neckerchief.
    
-   **Communiverse ambassador outfit:** More ceremonial robes and holographic accessories in some sequences; however, he often still looks like a kid thrown into a costume rather than a regal diplomat.
    

Pose language: slouched shoulders when embarrassed; wide‑armed gestures when excited; hugging himself in tense scenes; clutching radios or gadgets to his chest as comfort objects.

## 4. Relationships

### Olga Solis (aunt / guardian)

-   Complicated love: she is both his only surviving parent figure and an authority figure tied to the military.
    
-   He feels guilty for being “difficult” and sometimes reads her stress as disappointment.
    
-   Over the film, both learn to articulate their grief instead of burying it under duty (Olga) or escapism (Elio).
    

### Glordon

-   First true peer who likes him for who he is.
    
-   Relationship built on shared softness and fear of not living up to parental expectations.
    
-   Elio initially sees Glordon as the “alien best friend” from his fantasies, but gradually understands the real pain behind Glordon’s cheerful exterior.
    
-   Their dynamic carries subtle queer‑coded energy: tentative emotional confessions, hand‑holding in dangerous situations, sharing secrets about fear and identity.
    

### Bryce Markwell

-   Potential friend from school and camp; shares Elio’s fascination with aliens and ham radio.
    
-   Their early scenes show how easily a genuine connection can be derailed by social pressure (Caleb).
    
-   Later, Bryce becomes his ally on Earth, relaying signals back to space and apologizing for his role in the bullying.
    

### Caleb

-   Main human antagonist; physically and verbally bullies Elio.
    
-   Represents the pressure to perform “toughness” and to punish anyone who doesn’t fit that mold.
    
-   Elio never fully forgives him on screen, but the film hints that Caleb’s cruelty is rooted in his own fear and insecurity.
    

### Communiverse Ambassadors & Ooooo

-   Elio oscillates between awe, intimidation and mischief when facing alien authority.
    
-   His interactions with Ooooo in particular emphasize puzzle‑like banter: he treats the AI as both an exposition machine and an audience for his jokes.

## 8. For AI / LoRA Training

### Identity Tags (character‑level)

Use a consistent canonical name token:

-   `elio_solis`, `elio_(pixar)`, or a custom token like `elioPixarBoy` depending on your model conventions.
    

### Visual Tags (baseline look)

Combine with your global Pixar / SDXL style tags:

-   3d animated boy, 11 year old boy, short chubby boy, tan skin, dark messy hair, large brown eyes, eyepatch, green alien t‑shirt, green shorts, white socks, sneakers, purple cape, metal colander helmet, ham radio headset, night bedroom, glowing electronics.
    

### Variants

-   `elio_scout_uniform`: camp scout outfit with badges, neckerchief, no cape.
    
-   `elio_no_eyepatch`: later scenes where both eyes are visible.
    
-   `elio_ambassador_robes`: ceremonial alien outfit, floating platforms, Communiverse backgrounds.
    

### Negative / Avoid

-   Avoid mixing with unrelated Pixar kids who share similar proportions (e.g., Luca, Riley) by:
    
    -   Using film‑specific tags like `communiverse` or `montez_airbase`.
        
    -   Excluding words like “Italy, Portorosso, sea monster, San Francisco” in captions.
        

### Caption Seeds

Short caption templates you can expand per frame:

-   “Elio Solis, an 11‑year‑old boy with an eyepatch and a homemade space cape, adjusts his ham radio in a cluttered bedroom.”
    
-   “Elio stands anxiously before a council of glowing alien ambassadors, pretending to be Earth’s confident leader.”
    
-   “Elio and Glordon ride together through the colorful Communiverse, laughing with the wind in their faces.”
    
-   “At summer camp, Elio flinches as masked bullies corner him near the cabins.”
