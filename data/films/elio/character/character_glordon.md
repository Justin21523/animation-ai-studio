## Quick Reference

Glordon is a soft‑hearted alien boy designed by his warlord father to be a living weapon, but who instead wants nothing to do with war. Visually he looks like a huge, huggable space creature—part tardigrade, part hippo, with tiny horns, big teeth, and a squishy, marshmallow body. Emotionally he’s a people‑pleaser who masks fear and low self‑esteem with loud enthusiasm. His friendship with Elio anchors the film’s emotional core and embodies its message that vulnerability and empathy are forms of strength.

## 1. Background

-   Son of **Lord Grigon**, a feared Hylurgian warlord seeking dominance in the Communiverse.
    
-   Raised in a militarized culture where worth is measured in combat effectiveness and obedience.
    
-   Treated by Grigon as an asset or bargaining chip rather than as a child; canon material hints that there are or were other Glordon clones bred for war.
    
-   Despite this, Glordon is fascinated by peaceful cultures, games, and simple joys rather than weapons.
    

He represents a generational break from violent tradition, mirroring real‑world themes of kids rejecting their parents’ nationalism or machismo.

----------

## 2. Personality

Core traits:

-   **Big‑hearted and excitable:** Quick to laugh, hug and cheer; easily delighted by Earth music, snacks, and Elio’s weirdness.
    
-   **Conflict‑averse:** Flinches at shouting, hates training drills, would rather talk than fight.
    
-   **Insecure:** Internalizes his father’s criticism, worries about being “defective” because he is soft.
    
-   **Loyal:** Once he decides Elio is a friend, he puts himself in danger to protect him.
    
-   **Occasionally reckless:** His eagerness to prove himself leads to impulsive choices, especially when he thinks he can finally impress Grigon.
    

He often acts as emotional comic relief but becomes serious in key scenes where he confronts his father.

## 3. Physical Appearance & Visual Design

-   **Body type:** Large, rotund, pill‑shaped body with stubby arms and legs; reads as heavy but extremely soft.
    
-   **Surface:** Smooth, almost plush texture; pastel coloration with subtle spots or gradients.
    
-   **Head:** Broad mouth full of blunt teeth; expressive tongue often visible; small eyes set relatively close together; tiny horn nubs or spikes on the head or back.
    
-   **Silhouette:** Recognizable rounded “blob” outline; big presence in frame even next to adults.
    
-   **Movement:** Slight bounce with every step; when he runs, his body jiggles; when scared, he curls in on himself like a pill bug.
    

### Clothing & Gear

-   Frequently wears some form of **armor harness or carapace**, signifying his intended role as a soldier.
    
-   In more relaxed scenes, he may have only simple straps or accessories, letting his soft body read more clearly.
    
-   Sometimes carries Hylurgian tech (control panels, restraints) that feel like comically oversized toys in his hands.
    

For training, Glordon shots should often be tagged with both “soft alien boy” and “armored son of warlord” to preserve the duality.

## 4. Relationships

### Lord Grigon (father)

-   Source of both fear and longing. Glordon desperately wants approval but dreads what approval would actually mean (becoming a weapon).
    
-   Grigon talks about him as an asset; Glordon’s line about being a “bargaining chip” summarizes this entire relationship.
    
-   Their final confrontation—where Glordon refuses to fight and names his own desires—is central to the climax.
    

### Elio Solis

-   Very quickly recognizes Elio as “his person”: another kid who doesn’t fit expectations.
    
-   Teaches Elio how to navigate the Communiverse physically (transport systems, rules) and socially (which ambassadors are approachable).
    
-   Their friendship scenes frequently emphasize mutual support: Glordon encourages Elio when he panics; Elio later stands by Glordon against Grigon.
    
-   The dynamic can easily be read as romantically coded by viewers, but in canon it’s framed as intense platonic affection.
    

### Ooooo and the Ambassadors

-   Glordon is more comfortable with the Communiverse bureaucracy than Elio, having grown up around it, but still intimidated by high‑ranking ambassadors.
    
-   Tends to side with Ooooo and the more peace‑oriented factions.

## 5. Story Role & Key Moments

1.  **First meeting:** Glordon bursts into the narrative as a seemingly scary Hylurgian, but instantly reveals his softness by fangirling over Earth stuff and worrying about Elio’s safety.
    
2.  **Shared confessions:** Quiet scenes where the two boys talk about parents, expectations, and what they’re afraid of.
    
3.  **Capture & Imprisonment:** Voluntarily accompanies Elio onto Grigon’s ship rather than abandoning him to his fate.
    
4.  **“Bargaining chip” reveal:** Admits that his existence has always been transactional in his father’s eyes.
    
5.  **Climactic stand:** Publicly refuses to follow Grigon’s orders, essentially outing himself as soft, scared and unwilling to be a weapon.
    
6.  **Resolution:** Seen living a more self‑directed life in the Communiverse, with ongoing contact with Elio.
